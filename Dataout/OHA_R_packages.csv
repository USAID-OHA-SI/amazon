  values at the corresponding curve positions, or by coloring the

    'multiApply' package extends this paradigm with its only function, Apply, which
    efficiently applies functions taking one or a list of multiple unidimensional
    or multidimensional arrays (or combinations thereof) as input. The input
    arrays can have different numbers of dimensions as well as different dimension
    lengths, and the applied function can return one or a list of unidimensional or
    multidimensional arrays as output. This saves development time by preventing the
    R user from writing often error-prone and memory-inefficient loops dealing with
    multiple complex arrays. Also, a remarkable feature of Apply is the transparent
    use of multi-core through its parameter 'ncores'. In contrast to the base apply
