    (2) Advanced aggregation: Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function, 
        weighted, parallelized and fully custom data aggregation.
    (3) Advanced transformations: Fast row / column arithmetic, (grouped) replacing 
        and sweeping out of statistics, (grouped, weighted) scaling / standardizing, 
        between (averaging) and (quasi-)within (demeaning) transformations, 
        higher-dimensional centering (i.e. multiple fixed effects or polynomials),

 supported by functions that can determine the smoothing parameter

 validation and also by restricted maximum likelihood. For Kriging
 there is an easy to use function that also estimates the correlation

 spatial prediction. There are also many useful functions for plotting

    Extensions to this package implement additional backends for
